## Project README: Automated Process with UiPath

### Description

The project implements a robot using UiPath Studio to automate a series of tasks. The robot's functionality revolves around reading configurations from a `config.csv` file and executing actions such as email monitoring, web interactions, VPN setup, and data processing.

### Steps Implemented

#### Step 1: Read Configuration File

- **Description:** The robot begins by reading a `config.csv` file to retrieve necessary variables and configurations for the process.
- **Implementation:** All variables required throughout the process are defined in this file for easy management and configuration.

#### Step 2: Monitor and Retrieve Email Attachment

- **Description:** The robot monitors the specified email inbox for a test email with the subject "maids.cc RPA test". Upon receiving the email, it downloads the attached Excel file named `test.xlsx`.
- **Implementation:** The robot is configured to handle email retrieval and attachment download automatically.

#### Step 3: Create or Update Hide.me Account

- **Description:** The robot interacts with the hide.me website to login using the account and password associated with the provided email from config.csv file.

#### Step 4: Enable Hide.me VPN

- **Description:** The robot launches the hide.me VPN desktop application and enables the VPN without requiring account credentials.
- **Implementation:** This step ensures that the VPN is activated for subsequent actions, maintaining anonymity.

#### Step 5: Create Excel File `data.xlsx`

- **Description:** The robot creates `data.xlsx` file and starts writing into it the extracted data from https://www.fakenamegenerator.com/ (step 6) for further processing.
- **Implementation:** Data extraction ensures accurate retrieval of information needed for subsequent tasks.

#### Step 6: Process Data

- **Description:** For each record in the data table from Step 5, the robot performs the following actions:
  - Generates fake identity information from `fakenamegenerator.com`.
  - Extracts Name, Password, Birthday, Address, Phone, Country code, Company, and Occupation for each record.
  - Saves the extracted data into a result Excel file `data.xlsx` for reporting or further analysis.

### Conclusion

This project automates a complex series of tasks involving email handling, web interactions, and data processing. Each step is designed to be configurable through the `config.csv` file, allowing for flexibility and ease of maintenance. The robot ensures efficient execution of tasks while handling errors gracefully, as specified in the requirements.

### Usage

To deploy this automation:
1. Clone the repository to your local environment.
2. Ensure UiPath Studio is installed.
3. Update the `config.csv` file with required variables.
4. Execute the main workflow file in UiPath Studio.
